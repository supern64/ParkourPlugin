# ParkourPlugin
A plugin... for parkour!  
This plugin was designed for any average creative server to use. It's just plug and play.  
### Commands
- /parkour - Enters Parkour Mode (uses the ParkourPlugin.parkour node)
- /practice - Enters Practice Mode (uses the ParkourPlugin.practice node)
### Modes
There are 2 modes available in this plugin.
#### Parkour Mode
This is a mode designed for actual courses within a server.  
There is a dedicated timer and a fail count for use.  
You have to type /parkour to enter or exit this mode.  
Courses have to use these specific blocks to indicate some things.  
- Iron Block (used for starting the timer at the start of the course)
- Gold Block (used for setting the checkpoint)
- Diamond Block (used for stopping the timer at the end of the course)  

Once you start the course, you will see a menu pop-up in the hotbar. Their names should be self-explanatory.
#### Practice Mode
This is a mode dedicated to practicing certain jumps in a course.  
You have to type /practice to enter or exit this mode.  
This mode is simple. It only provides a menu for setting and teleporting to a spawnpoint.  
Everything should be self-explanatory.
